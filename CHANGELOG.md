# Development Timeline

## v1.0.0 (Initial Version)
### Features
- Basic static bundle scraping
- Predefined URL bundles in `url_bundles.py`
- Simple article formatting
- Basic directory structure

### Problems
- No dynamic content discovery
- Limited to predefined URLs
- No error handling
- No content validation
- Manual bundle maintenance required

## v1.1.0 (Content Processing)
### Features
- Added dynamic bundle detection
- Full page content processing with Jina reader
- GPT-4 content analysis
- Enhanced error handling
- Directory structure improvements

### Problems
- Rate limit errors with GPT-4 (429 errors)
- Too much content sent to GPT at once
- Memory issues with large pages
- No content chunking
- Slow processing of full pages

## v1.2.0 (Search-Based Approach)
### Features
- Split into content-based and search-based approaches
- Implemented Jina's search API
- Added multiple search strategies

### Problems
- Authentication issues with Jina search (401 errors)
- Search results not always relevant
- Inconsistent URL extraction
- Silent fallbacks to predefined bundles
- Search queries needed refinement

## v1.3.0 (Content Chunking and Logging)
### Features
- Added comprehensive logging system
- Implemented content chunking
- Added deduplication in chunking process
- Improved directory structure and file organization
- Better error handling and reporting

### Problems
- Model name issues (gpt-4o-mini compatibility)
- Directory structure errors in scrape_all.py
- Bundle names not reflecting technical themes
- Missing logs in articles/bundles/GPT_data directories

### Fixes Implemented
- Added detailed logging at each step
- Fixed directory creation and handling
- Improved content chunking with deduplication
- Added better error tracing
- Enhanced GPT prompt for technical bundling

## v1.4.0 (Current - Model and Processing Updates)
### Features
- Switched to GPT-4o-mini model
- Improved article extraction and filtering
- Enhanced bundle theme detection
- Better handling of Medium's content structure

### Current Problems
- Need to verify GPT-4o-mini model name
- Bundle names still need improvement
- Some logs missing from directories
- Raw content duplication issues

### Next Steps
- Verify correct model name and access
- Improve bundle naming logic
- Complete logging implementation
- Fix content duplication issues
- Add more error recovery mechanisms

## Future Plans
### v1.5.0 (Planned)
