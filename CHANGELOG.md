   - JSON parsing errors resolved
   - Model name corrected (from gpt-4o-mini to gpt-4)
   - Directory structure issues fixed
   - Response format standardized

3. Where We Left Off:
   - GPT returns rich bundle format:
     ```json
     {
         "bundles": {
             "bundle_name": {
                 "urls": ["url1", "url2"],
                 "topic": "description",
                 "reason": "explanation"
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - Need to convert to scrape_all.py format:
     ```json
     {
         "bundle_name": ["url1", "url2"]
     }
     ```

### Next Steps
1. Test format conversion thoroughly
