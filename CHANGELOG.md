# Development Timeline

## v1.0.0 (Initial Version)
### Features
- Basic static bundle scraping
- Predefined URL bundles in `url_bundles.py`
- Simple article formatting
- Basic directory structure

### Problems
- No dynamic content discovery
- Limited to predefined URLs
- No error handling
- No content validation
- Manual bundle maintenance required

## v1.1.0 (Content Processing)
### Features
- Added dynamic bundle detection
- Full page content processing with Jina reader
- GPT-4 content analysis
- Enhanced error handling
- Directory structure improvements

### Problems
- Rate limit errors with GPT-4 (429 errors)
- Too much content sent to GPT at once
- Memory issues with large pages
- No content chunking
- Slow processing of full pages

## v1.2.0 (Search-Based Approach)
### Features
- Split into content-based and search-based approaches
- Implemented Jina's search API
- Added multiple search strategies

### Problems
- Authentication issues with Jina search (401 errors)
- Search results not always relevant
- Inconsistent URL extraction
- Silent fallbacks to predefined bundles
- Search queries needed refinement

## v1.3.0 (Content Chunking and Logging)
### Features
- Added comprehensive logging system
- Implemented content chunking
- Added deduplication in chunking process
- Improved directory structure and file organization
- Better error handling and reporting

### Problems
- Model name issues (gpt-4o-mini compatibility)
- Directory structure errors in scrape_all.py
- Bundle names not reflecting technical themes
- Missing logs in articles/bundles/GPT_data directories

### Fixes Implemented
- Added detailed logging at each step
- Fixed directory creation and handling
- Improved content chunking with deduplication
- Added better error tracing
- Enhanced GPT prompt for technical bundling

## v1.4.0 (Current - Model and Processing Updates)
### Features
- Switched to GPT-4o-mini model
- Improved article extraction and filtering
- Enhanced bundle theme detection
- Better handling of Medium's content structure

### Current Problems
- Need to verify GPT-4o-mini model name
- Bundle names still need improvement
- Some logs missing from directories
- Raw content duplication issues

### Next Steps
- Verify correct model name and access
- Improve bundle naming logic
- Complete logging implementation
- Fix content duplication issues
- Add more error recovery mechanisms

## v1.4.1 (Current - JSON Parsing Debug)
### Features
- Attempted to fix JSON parsing from GPT response
- Added rich metadata storage
- Improved error logging

### Problems Identified
- JSON parsing still failing despite clean response
- Possible encoding or hidden character issues
- Need to verify GPT model compatibility
- Directory structure needs cleanup

### Changes Made
- Added response cleaning attempts
- Added alternate parsing methods
- Improved error logging
- Attempted to fix model name issues

### Next Steps
- Need to verify raw GPT response format
- Consider simpler response structure
- May need to modify GPT prompt
- Clean up directory structure

## v1.4.2 (Current - Response Format Debug)
### Latest Changes (2024-11-10)
- Fixed JSON parsing issues
- GPT now successfully returns bundles
- Implemented proper format conversion for scrape_all.py

### Current State
1. Working:
   - Jina content fetching
   - GPT analysis and bundling
   - Rich metadata storage
   - Basic format conversion

2. Issues Fixed:
   - JSON parsing errors resolved
   - Model name corrected (from gpt-4o-mini to gpt-4)
   - Directory structure issues fixed
   - Response format standardized

3. Where We Left Off:
   - GPT returns rich bundle format:
     ```json
     {
         "bundles": {
             "bundle_name": {
                 "urls": ["url1", "url2"],
                 "topic": "description",
                 "reason": "explanation"
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - Need to convert to scrape_all.py format:
     ```json
     {
         "bundle_name": ["url1", "url2"]
     }
     ```

### Next Steps
1. Test format conversion thoroughly
2. Verify bundle processing in scrape_all.py
3. Consider keeping rich metadata for later use
4. Add validation for converted format

### Open Questions
1. Should we store both formats?
2. How to use rich metadata in article formatting?
3. Need to handle failed conversions?

### Priority for Next Session
1. Test complete workflow with new format
2. Add error recovery for format conversion
3. Document metadata usage options
