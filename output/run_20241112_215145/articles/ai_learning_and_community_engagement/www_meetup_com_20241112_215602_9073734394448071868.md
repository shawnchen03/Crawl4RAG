What we’re about
----------------

ODSC brings together the open source and data science communities with the goal of helping its members learn, connect and grow.  
The focus of this Meetup group is to allow ODSC to work with Meetup groups, non-profits, and other organizations to present informative lectures, workshops, code sprints and networking events to help grow the use of open source languages and tools within the data science and data-centric community. As such, our specific goals are:

1\. Build a collaborative group to work with other Meetup groups, non-profits, and other organizations.

2\. Promote the use of open source languages and tools amongst data scientists and others.

3\. Host educational workshops.

4\. Spread awareness of new open source languages and tools that can be used in data science.

5\. Contribute back to the open source community.

Who is this meetup for?

• Data engineers, analysts, scientists, and other practitioners

• R, Python and other software engineers who work with data or want to learn

• Data visualization developers and designers

• Non-technical team leads, executives, and other decision makers from data centric startups and large companies looking to utilize open source tools

As AI systems become more integrated into healthcare diagnostics, addressing the disparities in model performance across diverse ethnic groups is paramount. This session will present a technical deep dive into the challenges of bias in medical imaging datasets and the resulting impact on healthcare outcomes for underrepresented populations. **We will begin by defining the types of bias** commonly found in machine learning models, with a case study in skin cancer detection. We will demonstrate how training on imbalanced datasets exacerbates disparities in diagnosing skin cancer across different racial groups. **Attendees will gain insight into practical techniques for rectifying these biases, including data augmentation, fairness-aware algorithms, and advanced evaluation metrics designed to assess model equity.** In addition to discussing technical solutions, we will also address the limitations and ethical considerations surrounding bias mitigation in healthcare AI, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in creating equitable diagnostic tools. _By the end of the session, participants will be equipped with the knowledge to implement fairness techniques in their own AI models, promoting better outcomes for all patient populations._ **Speaker's bio:** Laura Montoya, Founder and Managing Partner of Accel Impact Organizations _Laura is a tech leader focused on social impact and ethical AI. She founded Accel Impact Organizations, including Accel AI Institute and LXAI. With a background in biology, physics, and human development, Laura has worked at top tech companies like Intuit and has been a leader in tech diversity initiatives. She's a frequent speaker at industry conferences and has been featured in major publications._ **ODSC Links:** • Get free access to more talks/trainings like this at Ai+ Training platform: [https://hubs.li/H0Zycsf0](https://hubs.li/H0Zycsf0) • ODSC blog: [https://opendatascience.com/](https://opendatascience.com/) • Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI](https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI) • Twitter: [https://twitter.com/\_ODSC](https://twitter.com/_ODSC) & @odsc • LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science](https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science) • Slack Channel: [https://hubs.li/Q02zdcSk0](https://hubs.li/Q02zdcSk0) • Code of conduct: [https://odsc.com/code-of-conduct/](https://odsc.com/code-of-conduct/) * ![Image 3: Photo of Iryna Pidkovych](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/4/c/9/thumb_281682185.webp) * * ![Image 4: Photo of Eva](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/e/9/e/thumb_319556990.webp) * ![Image 5: Photo of Anil Kumar](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/3/a/thumb_310144922.webp) 4 attendees Attend](https://www.meetup.com/open-data-odsc/events/303885296/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events)

As AI systems become more integrated into healthcare diagnostics, addressing the disparities in model performance across diverse ethnic groups is paramount. This session will present a technical deep dive into the challenges of bias in medical imaging datasets and the resulting impact on healthcare outcomes for underrepresented populations. **We will begin by defining the types of bias** commonly found in machine learning models, with a case study in skin cancer detection. We will demonstrate how training on imbalanced datasets exacerbates disparities in diagnosing skin cancer across different racial groups. **Attendees will gain insight into practical techniques for rectifying these biases, including data augmentation, fairness-aware algorithms, and advanced evaluation metrics designed to assess model equity.** In addition to discussing technical solutions, we will also address the limitations and ethical considerations surrounding bias mitigation in healthcare AI, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in creating equitable diagnostic tools. _By the end of the session, participants will be equipped with the knowledge to implement fairness techniques in their own AI models, promoting better outcomes for all patient populations._ **Speaker's bio:** Laura Montoya, Founder and Managing Partner of Accel Impact Organizations _Laura is a tech leader focused on social impact and ethical AI. She founded Accel Impact Organizations, including Accel AI Institute and LXAI. With a background in biology, physics, and human development, Laura has worked at top tech companies like Intuit and has been a leader in tech diversity initiatives. She's a frequent speaker at industry conferences and has been featured in major publications._ **ODSC Links:** • Get free access to more talks/trainings like this at Ai+ Training platform: [https://hubs.li/H0Zycsf0](https://hubs.li/H0Zycsf0) • ODSC blog: [https://opendatascience.com/](https://opendatascience.com/) • Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI](https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI) • Twitter: [https://twitter.com/\_ODSC](https://twitter.com/_ODSC) & @odsc • LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science](https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science) • Slack Channel: [https://hubs.li/Q02zdcSk0](https://hubs.li/Q02zdcSk0) • Code of conduct: [https://odsc.com/code-of-conduct/](https://odsc.com/code-of-conduct/) * ![Image 3: Photo of Iryna Pidkovych](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/4/c/9/thumb_281682185.webp) * * ![Image 4: Photo of Eva](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/e/9/e/thumb_319556990.webp) * ![Image 5: Photo of Anil Kumar](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/3/a/thumb_310144922.webp) 4 attendees Attend](https://www.meetup.com/open-data-odsc/events/303885296/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events)
