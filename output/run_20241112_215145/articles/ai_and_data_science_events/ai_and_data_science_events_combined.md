In particular, Vivek is the lead researcher behind Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM 2, which were the first AI systems to obtain passing and expert level scores on US Medical License exam questions respectively. Med-PaLM was recently published in Nature and has been featured in The Scientific American, Wall Street Journal, The Economist, STAT News, CNBC, Forbes, New Scientist among others.

Vivek also led the development of Med-PaLM M, the first demonstration of a generalist biomedical AI system and AMIE, a research AI system, which surpassed Primary Care Physicians on multiple axes pertaining to diagnostic dialogue in an randomized study conducted in the style of a virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Vivek’s most recent work introduced Med-Gemini, a family of multimodal models for medicine with advanced reasoning, web search integration and multimodal understanding spanning millions of context tokens. Med-Gemini are state of the art on several medical benchmarks spanning text, images, surgical videos, EHRs, waveforms, genomics and more.

Over the years, Vivek’s research has been published in well-regarded journals and conferences like Nature, Nature Medicine, Nature Biomedical Engineering, JMLR, CVPR, ICCV and NeurIPS. It also forms the basis for several regulated medical device products under clinical trials at Google, including the NHS AI award winning breast cancer detection system Mammo Reader and the skin condition classification system DermAssist. Prior to Google, Vivek worked on multimodal assistant systems at Facebook AI Research and published award winning research, was granted multiple patents and deployed AI models to products at scale with hundreds of millions of users.

In particular, Vivek is the lead researcher behind Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM 2, which were the first AI systems to obtain passing and expert level scores on US Medical License exam questions respectively. Med-PaLM was recently published in Nature and has been featured in The Scientific American, Wall Street Journal, The Economist, STAT News, CNBC, Forbes, New Scientist among others.

Vivek also led the development of Med-PaLM M, the first demonstration of a generalist biomedical AI system and AMIE, a research AI system, which surpassed Primary Care Physicians on multiple axes pertaining to diagnostic dialogue in an randomized study conducted in the style of a virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Vivek’s most recent work introduced Med-Gemini, a family of multimodal models for medicine with advanced reasoning, web search integration and multimodal understanding spanning millions of context tokens. Med-Gemini are state of the art on several medical benchmarks spanning text, images, surgical videos, EHRs, waveforms, genomics and more.

Over the years, Vivek’s research has been published in well-regarded journals and conferences like Nature, Nature Medicine, Nature Biomedical Engineering, JMLR, CVPR, ICCV and NeurIPS. It also forms the basis for several regulated medical device products under clinical trials at Google, including the NHS AI award winning breast cancer detection system Mammo Reader and the skin condition classification system DermAssist. Prior to Google, Vivek worked on multimodal assistant systems at Facebook AI Research and published award winning research, was granted multiple patents and deployed AI models to products at scale with hundreds of millions of users.
